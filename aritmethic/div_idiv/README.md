The `DIV` and `IDIV` instructions are used in assembly language to perform division operations on integers. Here's an explanation of each instruction:

1. DIV (Unsigned Division):
   The `DIV` instruction is used to perform unsigned division in assembly language. It divides an unsigned integer value in a register or memory location by another value and stores the quotient and remainder in separate registers.

   Syntax:
   ```
   DIV source
   ```

   - `source`: The source operand can be a register or memory location that contains the value to be divided. The size of the operand determines the size of the division operation.

   Usage:
   - For 8-bit division, use the `AL` register as the dividend and the `source` operand as the divisor. The quotient will be stored in the `AL` register, and the remainder will be stored in the `AH` register.
   - For 16-bit division, use the `AX` register as the dividend and the `source` operand as the divisor. The quotient will be stored in the `AX` register, and the remainder will be stored in the `DX` register.
   - For 32-bit division, use the `EDX:EAX` register pair as the dividend and the `source` operand as the divisor. The quotient will be stored in the `EAX` register, and the remainder will be stored in the `EDX` register.

   Example:
   ```assembly
   MOV AX, 100    ; Load dividend into AX register
   MOV BX, 5      ; Load divisor into BX register
   DIV BX         ; Divide AX by BX (quotient stored in AX, remainder in DX)
   ```

2. IDIV (Signed Division):
   The `IDIV` instruction is used to perform signed division in assembly language. It works similarly to the `DIV` instruction but handles signed (positive or negative) integers.

   Syntax:
   ```
   IDIV source
   ```

   - `source`: The source operand can be a register or memory location that contains the value to be divided. The size of the operand determines the size of the division operation.

   Usage:
   - For 8-bit division, use the `AL` register as the dividend and the `source` operand as the divisor. The quotient will be stored in the `AL` register, and the remainder will be stored in the `AH` register.
   - For 16-bit division, use the `AX` register as the dividend and the `source` operand as the divisor. The quotient will be stored in the `AX` register, and the remainder will be stored in the `DX` register.
   - For 32-bit division, use the `EDX:EAX` register pair as the dividend and the `source` operand as the divisor. The quotient will be stored in the `EAX` register, and the remainder will be stored in the `EDX` register.

   Example:
   ```assembly
   MOV AX, -100   ; Load signed dividend into AX register
   MOV BX, 5      ; Load divisor into BX register
   IDIV BX        ; Divide AX by BX (quotient stored in AX, remainder in DX)
   ```

It's important to note that both `DIV` and `IDIV` instructions can generate exceptions if the division results in overflow (e.g., division by zero or quotient exceeding the maximum representable value). Therefore, it's a good practice to handle these exceptional cases in your code to ensure proper behavior and avoid unexpected program termination.

Remember to consult the documentation specific to your assembly language and processor architecture for precise details and considerations regarding the usage of `DIV` and `IDIV` instructions.
